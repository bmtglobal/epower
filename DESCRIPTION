Description: epower conducts a power analysis on beyond BACI sampling
    designs through INLA based inference and Monte Carlo simulation. Currently
    epower considers only univariate responses. The analysis allows for cross
    random effects between \code{Time} and \code{Site} in the design. The
    epower toolbox has been designed for use by ecologists with a sound
    understanding of the statistical principles of BACI designs. To assist the
    non-R user, BACI parameters are defined in an excel workbook template. The template 
    epower_interface_V1.3.xlsx should have been supplied with
    the package tar.gz file.
