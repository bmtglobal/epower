# epower
epower conducts a power analysis on beyond BACI sampling
    designs through INLA based inference and Monte Carlo simulation. Currently
    epower considers only univariate responses. The analysis allows for cross
    random effects between \code{Time} and \code{Site} in the design. The
    epower toolbox has been designed for use by ecologists with a sound
    understanding of the statistical principles of BACI designs. To assist the
    non-R user, BACI parameters are defined in an excel workbook template. The template 
    epower_interface_V1.3.xlsx should have been supplied with
    the package tar.gz file and is also available on github where this code is currently maintained.
    The 'epower' (V1.3) package is a BMT product which has been developed in collaboration with the Australian Institute 
    of Marine Science (AIMS), Queensland University of Technology (QUT) and Pink Lake Analytics. The method/code supporting 
    'epower' (v1.3) is described in: Fisher R, Shiell GR, Sadler RJ, Inostroza K, 
    Shedrawi G, Holmes TH, McGree JM (2019).  'epower' - an R package for power analysis of Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) 
    designs. Methods in Ecology and Evolution.
    'epower' is freely available to users under licence.  Licence for use explicitly precludes the incorporation of the 
    epower code into other programs which are subsequently sold or used for commercial purposes.
    Users are asked to please include the following acknowledgment:  
    Analyses were carried out using the software 'epower' V1.3 (BMT 2019) as described in Fisher et al (2019), 
    (BMT 2019) and based on the statistical programming platform R (R-Core Team, 2019).
